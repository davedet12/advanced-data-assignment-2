This repository contains data, analytic code, and findings for NYPD arrests for loitering between 2006 and 2024 (the last full year for the data.)

One analysis is included here and uses the following spreadsheet: NYPD_Arrests_Data_(Historic)_20251214.csv, downloaded from NYC Open Data. 
It has been edited to only include Loitering Arrests. It is found attached. 

These spreadsheets contain, the following columns relevant to the analysis: "PD_DESC" -- the description of the kind of loitering charge the person was arrested for; "ARREST_BOR0" -- the borough where the arrests have taken place; "ARREST_DATE_YEAR" -- an edited column of "ARREST_DATE", limited to only include the year. 

Methodology The notebook DeTurris-One-Last-Time.ipynb -- which uses the payroll data from October 2025 -- performs the following analyses:

Part 1: Remove dollar sign from salary amount to ease reclassification process; Part 2: Convert payment categories from objects to floats; Part 3: Limit analysis to only members of the Department of Corrections; Part 4: Attempt to provide summary of Department of Correction wages in time. Again, abandonded because there was an issue with formatting the data I couldn't figure out how to fix.

The notebook DDT-AdData-Assign-2.ipynb performs the following analyses:

Part 1: Lists Loitering Arrest Type by greatest to least; Part 2: Lists Loitering Arrest Amount by borough, from greatest to least, including a chart; Part 3: Lists loitering arrest by kind between 2006 and 2024 in the borough of Brooklyn, including a chart; Part 4: Lists loitering arrest by kind between 2006 and 2024, in Staten Island for comparison, including a chart; Part 6: Compares top loitering arrest charges between 2006 and 2020 - 2024, including a chart. 

Outputs The notebook's output is a bar graph png, found in link along with data.
